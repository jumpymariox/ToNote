  Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.
  In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
  I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:
  I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.

  不到下雪的时节，我却开始贪恋炉火了，赵李红很不高兴。她一边往炉膛填柴火，一边朝我软塌塌的肚子踹了一脚，说："废物！"
